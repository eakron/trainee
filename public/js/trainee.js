Thisincludes instance-wide metadata such as logon accounts, endpoints, linked servers, and systemconfiguration settings.\nNot C: This is already the default settings.\n* By default, the Max Degree Of Parallelism setting has a value of 0, which means that the maximumnumber of processors used for parallel processing is controlled automatically. Essentially, SQL Server usesthe actual number of available processors, depending on the workload. To limit the number of processorsused for parallel processing to a set amount (up to the maximum supported by SQL Server), change theMax Degree Of Parallelism setting to a value greater than 1. A value of 1 tells SQL Server not to useparallel processing."
